# Camera logger image annotation
In this practical, you will learn how to process and annotate the camera data using a simple Python-based Graphical User Interface (GUI). Labelled daily-living data is essential to training many activity recognition models. By going through the process of annotating your own data, you will begin to understand some of the difficulties of simplifying real life to a set of labels. 

We have elected to use a simple Python-based GUI for several reasons. Firstly, we wanted to to use an offline tool so that your data can stay on your computer. Secondly, we wanted to minimise the amount of additional software dependencies required to annotate your data. Finally, although there are many more sophisticated image annotations tools out there, each of them require some level of tweaking to do what we want them to do. Instead of spending time trying to understand and adapt an existing tool to our needs, we decided to quickly prototype our own. If any of you wish to try improve the funcitonality of the GUI, we have provided all the source code for you to edit as you wish.
