# Step Counter Tutorial

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide for implementing a step count algorithm using Python. It outlines the implementation of a hybrid step count model developed by Small et al. (2023)[[1]](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.20.23285750v1). It is part of the RMLHDS (Remote Monitoring of Long-Term Health Conditions) project by OxWearables.

The tutorial is available as a Jupyter notebook on GitHub, and can be accessed via the following link: https://github.com/OxWearables/RMLHDS/blob/main/8_stepcount/Tutorial.ipynb

## Overview
This tutorial covers the following topics:

* Downloading of OxWalk dataset
* Data pre-processing
* Peak detection
* Feature extraction
* Walking detection
* End to end model training
* Model evaluation

## Requirements
To run the step count algorithm, you will need:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Python packages listed in the [https://github.com/OxWearables/RMLHDS/blob/main/](https://github.com/OxWearables/RMLHDS/blob/main/environment.yml) file

## Usage
To use the step count algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/OxWearables/RMLHDS.git`
2. Navigate to the 8_stepcount directory: cd RMLHDS/8_stepcount
3. Open the Jupyter notebook: jupyter notebook Tutorial.ipynb
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to implement the step count algorithm

## Conclusion
This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide for implementing a step count algorithm using Python. By following the steps outlined in the tutorial, you can develop a step count algorithm that can be used to analyze data from wearable devices and provide insights into physical activity levels.
