# Step Counter Tutorial

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide for implementing a step count algorithm using Python. It outlines the implementation of a hybrid step count model developed by Small et al. (2023)[[1]](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.20.23285750v1). It is part of the RMLHDS (Reproducible Machine Learning in Health Data Science) project by OxWearables.

The tutorial is available as a Jupyter notebook on GitHub, and can be accessed via the following link: https://github.com/OxWearables/RMLHDS/blob/main/8_stepcount/Tutorial.ipynb

## Overview
This tutorial covers the following topics:

* Downloading of OxWalk dataset
* Data pre-processing
