# Sleep detection practical

In this practical, we just need all the files in [9_sleep](https://github.com/OxWearables/RMLHDS/tree/main/9_sleep)

You only need to follow the instructions in `sleep.ipynb`

In this practical, we have several aims:
* Implement your own sleep classifier using a heuristic-based method or a published method. 
* Evaluate the sleep classifier.
* Estimate different sleep parameters from your model prediction. 
* Put everything together in a nice infographic.
