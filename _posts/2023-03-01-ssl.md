# Self-supervised learning

In this practical, we will need two things:
* The SSL notebook and related utility script. Download them [here](https://github.com/OxWearables/RMLHDS/tree/main/6_self_supervised_learning)

* You will also need to have the Capture-24 datasets in a numpy format. You should already obtain the files in the previous practicals. If you don't have access to these to files, either ask a fellow coworker who does or ask your tutor for help:

    * `X.npy`
    * `y.npy`

Then you should be ready to go. In this practical, you are going to try using the pre-trained models, develop your own self-supervised learning tasks and try exploring different types of fine-tuning for transfer learning.
