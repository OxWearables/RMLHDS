  Welcome to the Reproducible Machine Learning in Health Data Science program at the University of Oxford. We are thrilled to have you join us in this exciting journey. 
  Throughout this tutorial series, we will guide you through the complete life-cycle of a real-world 
  machine learning project, including data collection, annotation, processing, and model construction. 
  Although our focus is primarily on wearable devices, the development pipeline we will cover can also be 
  applied to other applications. So whether you are a seasoned machine learning practitioner or just 
  starting out, we hope that this series will equip you with the skills and knowledge necessary to tackle 
  real-world problems in this exciting field.
