# Reproducible Machine Learning in Health Data Science

## How to edit
Editing is super simple. All you need to do is to edit the relevant readme files in `_posts` and push to the remote. Then the web page will be updated. 

## How to build the tutorials locally?
Building the website locally will need some time. You can follow the instructions [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Unless you want to make structural changes to the repo, there is no need to do this step.

After you have installed Jekyll, do the following 
```shell
bin/boostrap

# start live view
bin/start
```
The tutorials will be live on `localhost:4000`. You might want to do `bundle add webrick` if you have Ruby>=3.0.0.


For prac1, the reference data is stored on rescomp at `/well/doherty/projects/stuff/teaching`.
